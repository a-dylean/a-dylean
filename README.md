Hey there 👋

My name is Alisa Tonkopiy, and I'm a self-taught programmer currently based in 🗼🥐 Paris, France.

After working for 5 years in business consulting services I decided to make a career switch and since April, 2021 I am on my way to become a Full-stack software engineer.

Currently, I am mostly focused on building web apps using TypeScript and React.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and pushing my own limits.

Bienvenue!👩🏻‍💻
