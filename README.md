My name is Alisa Tonkopiy and since November, 2023 I am a student at 42 school based in 🗼🥐 Paris, France.

After working for 3+ years in corporate consulting I decided to make a career switch and now I am on my way to become a software engineer.

I am passionate about building web interfaces and full-stack apps as well as discovering and learning new technologies and pushing my own limits.

Bienvenue!👩🏻‍💻
