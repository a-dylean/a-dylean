Hey there 👋

My name is Alisa Tonkopiy, and I'm a self-taught software developer currently based in 🗼🥐 Paris, France.

After working for 3+ years in business consulting services I decided to make a career switch and since May, 2022 I am on my way to become a Full-stack engineer.

As of now, I am mostly focused on building web apps using TypeScript and React for frontend and Node.js and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for backend.

Since August, 2023 I am also a student at 42 school. I am passionate about learning new technologies and pushing my own limits.

Bienvenue!👩🏻‍💻
